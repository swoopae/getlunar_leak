# lunar source leak

not really proud of this, i started this 1 year and a few months back when i thought spamming namespaces everywhere was good code

last time this source was actively worked on was like september 2020 and even then, i barely touched it because i burnt myself out on cs altogether, so offsets are probably outdated
some attention depraved dumbasses think it's cool that they have this source even though it has very few worthwhile things in it

shoutout laxol who was the first one that threatened me with leaking the source back before it was cool, prolex & his buddy aether who started trashtalking me for no reason and claiming they had the source and were going to leak it as well (but didn't as far as i'm aware) and the fuckwad that started sending it around the community for some reason (still don't know who that person is)

the only things that are cool in this source are the menu framework, the rain and the visuals. (maybe some other shit i forgot about too? dunno)
if you're at least somewhat competent, you (probably) don't have anything to learn from this source
